# Vision Transformer Project

## Overview
This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using PyTorch for image classification on CIFAR-10.

## Directory Structure
- `models/`: Contains ViT model components.
- `training/`: Training logic.
- `evaluation/`: Evaluation logic.
- `utils/`: Utility functions (data loading, visualization).
- `experiments/`: Experiment logging.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`
3. Results will be saved in `logs/`.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for details.
